Familiarize yourself with each step and practice it separately before trying to do it all together. This will help you keep track of what you need to do at each stage.\n\n2. **Use Estimation**: Before you start dividing, try to estimate how many times the divisor can go into the first part of the dividend. This will help you make educated guesses and avoid mistakes as you work through the problem. Estimation can also help reduce the size of numbers you're working with, making calculations easier.\n\n3. **Check Your Work**: After you find your quotient, you can check your work by multiplying the quotient by the divisor and adding any remainder. If the result matches the original dividend, you know your division is correct. This is a great way to build confidence in your long division skills.\n\n---\n\n### Request 2: ASCII Representation of a Simple Long Division Problem\n\nHere's a simple long division example using ASCII art:\n\n```\n     3\n   -----\n4 | 12\n     -12\n   -----\n       0\n```\n\nIn this example, we are dividing 12 by 4. The quotient is 3, and there is no remainder.",
